I have faced many challanges while doing this project and learnt so many things. Here are the top few Learnings from this project:

1. I have learnt about the url configuration of django.
2. I have a solid understanding of django models now. Now I know how to do basic crud operations using django.
3. I have made a custom script to convert djason data to django models.
4. I have got some idea of visualizing data in Line and bar charts from django database.
5. Last but not the least, I have used Bootstrap and Chart js for the first time in this project. I found both of them amazaing.
